This is a simple list of music that I'm currently listening to. Feel free to add your own artists if you think i'll like them. 

View all posts '/posts'
Posts by user (not all users have posts) '/posts/:userid'
create a post but sending post request to '/posts/:userid'. You can't edit a post, but you can delete a post with a delete request to the post/:id and then make a new one if you'd like. 

View my current top 6 in the jokebox with '/artists'
You can post to the jukebox by sending a post request to '/artists', but that's preferably just for my use.I can also update my favorite artist's info with a put request to '/artists/:id'. Same goes for delete requests. 

View all the users with '/users/. You can set up a new user account with post request to '/users'. You can also update them or delete them with a put/delete requests to the '/users/:id'.


Best,
Jake
